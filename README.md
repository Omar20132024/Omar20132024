- ⚡ Fun fact: The first computer "bug" was an actual bug. In 1947, computer pioneers at Harvard University found a moth trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer, which was causing issues. They removed the insect and taped it into their logbook, coining the term "bug" to refer to computer glitches.
This early encounter with a literal computer bug highlights the whimsical origins of some common computing terminology. Even as technology has advanced dramatically, the language we use to describe it has been shaped by these quirky historical origins.
